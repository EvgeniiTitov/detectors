Implemented v3 and smaller v4 in Python using PyTorch framework.
Increased dataset
Retrained new smaller v4 model
Wrote test scripts to emulate working with archive
Wrote module that saves data in the requested JSON format
Tested on a simple Flask server (though cant send tars yet)


TO ASK:
1. Threads: preprocessing (into batches, yolo preproc etc) / inference / result processing


TODO:
1. Test preprocessing pipeline 2 - keeping aspect ratio with padding
2. Confidence to the logs
